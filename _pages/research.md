My research insterest lies broadly in stochastic approximation, MCMC, optimization, and machine learning.

- **Zero-Order Langevin Monte Carlo via SPSA under Noisy Function Measurements** 1/10-current
  - <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;">H. Li</span>, J. Spall, manuscript in final polish; planned submission in Dec 2025



- **Fine-tuning FinBERT with Few-Shot Weak Supervision for Financial News Sentiment** 8/24-2/25
Supervised by Prof. Helyette Geman, Johns Hopkins University
 
▪ Motivation & method: Applied few-shot in-context labeling with gold examples to generate weak labels at scale, using consistency voting and confidence filtering for denoising; then fine-tuned FinBERT (LoRA) with temporal splits and probability calibration. The fine-tuned model outperformed the baseline FinBERT in accuracy
▪ Multi-ticker disambiguation: Designed three datasets for multi-ticker articles (single-ticker, most-mentioned, and mention-share weighting); most-mentioned gave the highest accuracy and strongest 2-day Granger-prediction
▪ Exploratory identification: Applied Difference-in-Differences around pre-specified shocks and Regression Discontinuity Design at set thresholds, uncovering potential causality between sentiment factors and stock returns

- **Causal Inference on High-Dimensional Time Series using LLM-Guided Discovery** 10/24-2/25
Supervised by Prof. Helyette Geman, Johns Hopkins University

▪ Developed novel framework leveraging causal order priors generated by LLMs to constrain discovery algorithms, enabling efficient learning of sparse structures and mitigating the curse of dimensionality
▪ Designed and implemented soft constraints, conflict checks, and multi-round prompting, to minimize impact of spurious directions from imperfect LLM outputs, ensuring robustness and reliability of the inferred graphs
