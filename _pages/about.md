I am now a first year PhD student in Statistics at Michigan State University (MSU). Before joining MSU, I obtained M.S. degree in Financial Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University, supervised by [Prof. James Spall](https://sites.google.com/view/james-spall) and [Prof. Helyette Geman](https://helyettegeman.com/). I got my B.Sc. degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), major in Statistics. 

I am interested in developing efficient and provably effective methods for statistical learning and decision-making in real-world systems under uncertain data. I am particularly excited about stochastic optimization/sampling, nonconvex optimization, reinforcement learning, and diffusion models. My current research studies Zeroth-Order Langevin Monte Carlo via SPSA for gradient-free sampling when only noisy function measurements are available.

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, playing tennis, and kayaking. In another chapter, I played for HUST’s basketball second team in CUBAL Division II as an amateur player.
